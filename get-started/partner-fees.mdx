Partner fees allow you to generate income by charging a fee on each transaction completed via your platform. These fees are automatically collected from users during the transaction and deposited into your designated wallet.

## What are partner fees?

Partner fees are optional charges you can apply to transactions processed through the Lumx platform. Once configured, the platform automatically collects the fee from the user and transfers it to your wallet once the transaction is completed.

To create a partner fee, you can use the [dashboard](https://dashboard.lumx.io/?to=%2Fsettings%2Fdeveloper-fees).
Alternatively, you can do it via [API](/api-reference/partner-fees/create-a-partner-fee)

### Types of partner fees

You can choose between two types of fees:

- **Percentage fee** – A percentage of the total transaction amount
- **Flat fee** – A fixed amount per transaction

Fees can be set independently for:

- **On-ramp** (fiat → stablecoin)
- **Off-ramp** (stablecoin → fiat)

### How to configure partner fee

- **Dashboard**:
  Click [here](https://dashboard.lumx.io/?to=%2Fsettings%2Fdeveloper-fees),
  choose a project and on the following screen, you will be able to configure them.

- **API**: Use the [create a partner fee
  endpoint](/api-reference/partner-fees/create-a-partner-fee).

<Note>
	You need to be a project admin or owner to create a Partner fee on the
	**dashboard**.
</Note>

### Fee destination: EVM wallet

To receive fees, you must register a valid **EVM-compatible wallet address**.
You can:

- Use a Lumx-generated wallet
- Add your own treasury wallet

<Note>
	We recommend **using sandbox** mode to test and confirm fee delivery before
	going live.
</Note>

### Fee application

Partner fees must be passed at the appropriate stage depending on the transaction type:

- **Locked Rate**: Include the partner fee when generating the **exchange rate**.
- **Floating Rate**: Include the partner fee when initiating the **on/off-ramp transaction**.

<Info>
	If no partner fee is provided during the transaction, the system will
	automatically apply your **default fee**, if one is configured. If no default
	is set, **no fee will be charged**.

### How fees are collected and delivered

- Fees are automatically collected from the end-user during the transaction.
- Once the transaction is complete, fees are deposited to your wallet.
