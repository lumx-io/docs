All entities using Lumx services must agree to our [Terms and Conditions (“TC”)](https://lumx.io/terms-of-use) and our [Privacy Policy](https://lumx.io/privacy-policy). The preferred approach is to incorporate these documents within your own, ensuring your end users review and accept the terms before using Lumx services.

If incorporating the TC directly is not feasible, we provide a dedicated [Terms and Conditions](https://lumx.io/terms-of-use)[ link](https://lumx.io/terms-of-use). Entities can share this link with their end users to ensure they agree to the terms before proceeding with Lumx services.[

Alternatively, we provide a dedicated Terms and Conditions link, which can be shared with entities so that their end users accept the terms before proceeding.

Every beneficiary must undergo a KYC/B (Know Your Customer/Business) process for identity verification.

<Note>
  KYC and KYB may not be available for beneficiaries in specific jurisdictions.

### Transaction limits

We apply transaction limits based on the KYC/B level of beneficiaries. In other words, as transaction amounts increase, more stringent verification and compliance levels are required to ensure security and regulatory compliance.

### Status progression

KYC/KYB status can progress according to the following flow:

* `PENDING` → `UNDER REVIEW` → `APPROVED`

For low-risk regions, the review process can be completed within seconds. However, in high-risk locations or cases requiring manual review, verification may take 1 to 2 business days.

* `PENDING` → `UNDER REVIEW` → `CHANGES REQUESTED` → `APPROVED / REJECTED`

If the entity's provided information is incomplete or inconsistent, Lumx may request corrections or additional documents before concluding the review.

* `PENDING` → `UNDER REVIEW` → `REJECTED`

In some cases, an entity may be rejected if the submitted information is invalid or inconsistent, such as an incorrect tax identification number or unrecognized documents.
