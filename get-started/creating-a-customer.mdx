title: 'Creating a customer'
---

This document outlines the required steps to create an Individual or Business customer in the **Lumx** platform. The following steps apply for a workflow using the API but you can also use the [dashboard](https://dashboard.lumx.io/?to=%2Fcustomers).

<Warning>
	We have a **link** available provided by our compliance partner, enabling
	easier interactions and better rate of approval. It's available to use via API
	or via dashboard.
</Warning>

## 1. Create a customer

**Endpoint:** [`POST /customers`](/api-reference/customers/create-a-customer)

Registers a new customer on the platform. Customers can be of type **Individual** or **Business**. The response includes an `id`, which is required for subsequent operations.

<Note>
	When creating a **Business** customer, it is mandatory to provide information
	about any beneficiaries holding more than 20% ownership. These beneficiaries
	will be automatically linked to the Business customer — there is **no need**
	to create an Individual customer separately to associate them.

    If the **Business** customer has beneficiaries that are also companies, the **only** way to complete the KYB is via link. In case, the customer only has individuals as shareholders, the flow can be finished using our API.

</Note>

## 2. Upload required documents

**Endpoint:** [`POST /customers/:id/documents`](/api-reference/customers/upload-a-document)

Allows you to upload the documents required for identity and/or business verification. This API endpoint uses **FormData** to handle uploads.

### Requirements by customer type

#### Individual customers

The following documents are mandatory:

- One identity document (digital version also **accepted**):
  - `id_card` (e.g., RG)
  - `drivers_license` (e.g., CNH)
  - `passport`
- One `proof_of_address` (proof of address)

<Warning>
	If your document is double-sided, you should send first the front side, then
	the back side.
</Warning>

#### Business customers

The following documents are mandatory:

- Legal incorporation document:
  - `incorporation_articles` (e.g., articles of incorporation, certificate of formation, or state business registration extract)
  - `incumbency_cert`
  - `shareholder_registry`
- Documents of all beneficiaries (same as required for Individual customers, in this case you should also send the **beneficiaryId** on the request)
- One `proof_of_address` (dated within the last 3 months), such as:
  - Valid lease agreement
  - Utility bill (water, electricity, internet, etc.)
  - Bank statement

**Notes:**

- Accepted file formats: `PDF`, `PNG`, or `JPEG`
- Maximum file size per document: **50MB**
- All documents must be clearly legible and fully visible

### Common examples of valid proof of address (individuals)

- Property tax bill (valid for up to 1 year)
- Mortgage agreement
- Landline phone bill
- Utility bills (water, electricity, gas, internet)
- Rental agreement signed by both landlord and tenant
- Bank-issued credit card statement

<Note>
	Documents must include the customer’s **full name** and **residential
	address**. Both physical (scanned) and digital (PDF) documents are accepted.
</Note>

## 3. Start customer verification

**Endpoint:** [`POST /customers/:id/verifications`](/api-reference/customers/start-a-customer-verification)

Initiates the KYC/KYB verification process for the customer.  
To execute this operation, **all required documents** for the respective customer type must have been previously uploaded using the **Upload Documents** API, including beneficiaries if applicable.

---

## 4. Check verification status

**Endpoint:** [`GET /customers/:id/verifications`](/api-reference/customers/read-a-customer-verification)

Returns the current verification status of the customer: `approved`, `temporary_rejection`, `final_rejection`, `pending`.

This API allows you to monitor the status of the verification process initiated via the **Start Customer Verification** endpoint. The response includes:

- Overall customer verification status
- Status of each submitted document
- Details on any pending or rejected documents

<Note>
	It can take up to a day for a KYB to be processed, for a KYC it should only
	take a couple minutes.
</Note>
