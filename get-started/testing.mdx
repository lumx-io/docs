To simulate the journey in the Sandbox environment, we deployed the USDL, Lumx USD stablecoin for testing purposes. Developers can emulate on-ramping, transferring stablecoin between wallets, and off-ramping with USDL.

### On-ramp from fiat to USDL

After creating a Customer, you can use the customer id created to simulate on-ramps to USDL with the [on-ramp endpoint](/api-reference/endpoints/transactions/on-ramp). You can pick any available source fiat currency and target stablecoin, and we will automatically mint the USDL for you and send it to the Customer's wallet.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api-sandbox.lumx.io/transactions/on-ramp \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
    "customerId": "<CUSTOMER_ID>",
    "sourceCurrency": "BRL",
    "targetCurrency": "USDC",
    "amount": "100.99",
    "payment": {
      "rail": "pix"
    }
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Transfer USDL between wallets

You can also [transfer](/api-reference/endpoints/transactions/transfer) USDL between wallets. You can pick any available stablecoin and we will automatically route it to USDL and transfer it to the specific wallet.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api-sandbox.lumx.io/transactions/transfer \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
    "currency": "USDC",
    "from": "<CUSTOMER_1_WALLET_ID>",
    "to": "<CUSTOMER_2_WALLET_ID>",
    "amount": "100.123456"
  }'
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Off-ramp from USDL to fiat

After creating a Customer and simulating on-ramping, you can use the customer id created to simulate off-ramps to USDL with the [off-ramp endpoint](/api-reference/endpoints/transactions/off-ramp). You can pick any available source stablecoin and target fiat currency, we will route it to USDL for you and simulate the off-ramp.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash cURL
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api-sandbox.lumx.io/transactions/off-ramp \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
    "customerId": "<CUSTOMER_ID>",
    "sourceCurrency": "USDC",
    "targetCurrency": "BRL",
    "amount": "100.123456",
    "payment": {
      "rail": "pix",
      "keyValue": "<KEY_VALUE>",
      "keyType": "<KEY_TYPE>"
    }
  }'
  ```
