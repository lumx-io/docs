title: "Create a Customer"
---

This document outlines the required steps to create an Individual or Business customer in the **Lumx** platform.

## 1. Create a Customer

**Endpoint:** `POST /customers`

Registers a new customer on the platform. Customers can be of type **Individual** or **Business**. The response includes a `customerId`, which is required for subsequent operations.

<Note >
When creating a **Business** customer, it is mandatory to provide information
about any beneficiaries holding more than 20% ownership. These beneficiaries
will be automatically linked to the Business customer — there is **no need**
to create an Individual customer separately to associate them.

</Note>
