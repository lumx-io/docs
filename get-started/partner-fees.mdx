By creating a Partner fee, you can collect customized fees as funds are transferred using our platform. The fees are split at the moment of the transaction, taken out of the customer's transaction amount, and deposited in a wallet designated for you.

## How to create a Partner fee

To create a partner fee, you can use the [dashboard](https://dashboard.lumx.io/?to=%2Fsettings%2Fdeveloper-fees), select the project, go to the Settings page, and create your fee.
Alternatively, you can do it via [API](/api-reference/partner-fees/create-a-partner-fee)

<Note>You need to be a project admin or owner to create a Partner fee.</Note>

### EVM wallet

In order for us to send the fees to you, you need to register a valid EVM wallet address. You can either use a wallet generated by us or add your proprietary treasury wallet. You can use our sandbox mode to verify that the address is correctly receiving funds.

### Fee configuration

We support both flat and percentage fees for on/off-ramp transactions.

### Fee usage

- For locked quote transactions, the partner fee should be passed when creating
  the **exchange rate**.

- For a floating rate, the partner fee should be passed when calling the **on/off ramp transaction endpoint**.

<Info>
	If no fee is provided when creating a quote/transaction, the default partner
	fee will be used. If no fee is found, then **no fees are considered**.

### Revenue

Currently, the revenue is shown on the [partner fees page](https://dashboard.lumx.io/?to=%2Fsettings%2Fdeveloper-fees).
