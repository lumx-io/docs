Orchestration provides a seamless interface for converting between fiat and stablecoins, enabling businesses to integrate these transitions effortlessly into their platforms. This module supports flexible flows that abstract the complexities of provider-specific implementations.

#### On-Ramp process

The **On-Ramp** process enables customers to convert fiat currency into stablecoins, which are then deposited into their designated wallets.

##### **Overview:**

1. **Customer request:**

   - The client initiates an on-ramp request by specifying:

     - Customer details

     - Exchange rate

     - Desired stablecoin

     - The fiat amount to be converted

   - Lumx validates the request and prepares the necessary transaction details.

2. **Payment generation:**

   - Lumx generates a payment instruction (e.g., Pix code or similar) and provides it to the customer for fiat payment.

   - A transaction is created with the status `awaiting_payment`.

3. **Payment confirmation:**

   - Once the customer completes the payment, Lumx receives a confirmation (via webhook or provider notification).

   - The transaction status is updated to `funds_received`.

4. **Stablecoin delivery:**

   - Lumx transfers the specific stablecoin to the customer’s designated wallet.

   - The transaction is finalized with the status `success` upon confirmation of the transfer on the blockchain.

#### Off-Ramp process

The **Off-Ramp** process allows customers to convert stablecoins into fiat currency, which are then transferred to their associated bank accounts.

##### **Overview:**

1. **Customer request:**

   - The client initiates an off-ramp request by providing:

     - Customer details

     - Exchange rate

     - Stablecoin to be off-ramped and its amount

     - Bank account or payment details for fiat transfer

   - Lumx validates the ownership of the destination account to ensure compliance.

2. **Transaction setup:**

   - Lumx prepares a transaction for the stablecoin-to-fiat conversion, requiring customer authorization.

   - The transaction starts with the status `awaiting_signature`.

3. **Stablecoin transfer:**

   - The customer authorizes and executes the transfer of the specified stablecoin to the Lumx or provider-designated wallet.

   - The transaction status is updated to `pending` or `processing`.

4. **Fiat transfer:**

   - Lumx initiates a fiat transfer to the customer’s specified bank account.

   - Upon confirmation of the fiat transfer, the transaction status is updated to `success`.

### Transaction lifecycle for On/Off-Ramps

Both on-ramp and off-ramp processes share a common lifecycle to ensure transparency and traceability:

- **Statuses:**

  - `awaiting_payment`: Awaiting customer action to complete fiat payment.

  - `awaiting_signature`: Waiting for customer authorization for a stablecoin transfer.

  - `funds_received`: Fiat payment or stablecoin transfer has been confirmed.

  - `pending` or `processing`: In-progress actions such as stablecoin deposit, transfer, or fiat payout.

  - `success`: Transaction completed successfully.

- **Webhooks:**
  Lumx integrates provider notifications via webhooks to confirm critical actions, such as payment receipts, stablecoin transfers, and fiat payouts.
